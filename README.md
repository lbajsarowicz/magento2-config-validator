# Magento 2 `config.php` validation

The module answers one of the most common mistakes made when maintaining Magento 2 projects.

Outdated `config.php` file in the repository leads to serious issues with environment consistency after the deployment.

When your **Deployment Configuration** is not in line with the codebase, exit code is `1` (ERROR)

## Installation

```shell
composer require lbajsarowicz/module-config-validator
```
